//This code waits 5 seconds and prints out "Done!" when the 5 seconds are up. Note that this code will not work in the interpreter because it is not designed for handling callbacks.
var callback = function(){
    console.log("React Developer Kimaiyo");
};

setTimeout(callback,2000);

//It is also possible to define callbacks as anonymous functions, like so:
setTimeout(function(){
    console.log("Django developer john");
},5000);
